\description{
This dataset contains detailed field-level information on the status and functionality of rural water points across Malawi,
collected as part of the USAID Flood Response initiative between 2019 and 2020. The data was gathered using the mWater mobile data
collection platform, enabling standardized, GPS-tagged assessments directly from field locations.
